# ðŸ’» 2nd Semester Tasks â€“ Object-Oriented Programming (C++)

This repository contains various C++ programming tasks completed during my **2nd semester**, focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. These tasks helped me build a solid understanding of OOP principles by writing modular, reusable, and clean C++ code.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- Classes and Objects
- Constructors and Destructors
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical)
- Polymorphism (Compile-time & Runtime)
- Function Overloading and Overriding
- Abstract Classes and Virtual Functions
- File Handling in C++
- Templates
- Operator Overloading
- Mini OOP Projects (e.g., Student Management System, Bank System)

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply OOP principles
- Write modular and reusable C++ code
- Implement real-world logic using class-based design
- Practice inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
- Work with file I/O in C++ for persistence

## ðŸ’» How to Compile & Run

Using `g++`:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
